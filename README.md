# Monster Hunter Tools
This place will mostly host Monster Hunter Tri tools. Usually there will be Python2 modules, I'll try my best to provide both Python2 and Python3 when possible.

The goal is to easily add/edit/delete quests, items, weapons, armors, save contents and others types of data from the game with appropriate tools.
